page 5:
The code for mem.c as presented in the chapter does not require an argument, although the code on GitHub does: https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-code/blob/master/intro/mem.c

Passing an argument works for both versions, so:
prompt> ./mem
should be
prompt> ./mem 0

page 6:
Similar to above:
./mem & ./mem &
should be
./mem 0 & ./mem 0 &

page 8:
gcc -o thread thread.c -Wall -pthread
should be
gcc -o threads threads.c -Wall -pthread

page 14:
Berkeley Time-Sharing System [S+68]
should be
Berkeley Time-Sharing System [S68]
